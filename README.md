Hello, this is the place where I'll host most of my front-end-based projects, feel free to visit them through the following links:

## [My Portfolio](https://davintristanieson.github.io/dist/portfolio)
**(15/05/2022)**
I needed a place to store and display all the projects (at least, those related to front-end web development) that I plan to make in the future. Moreover,  I need to start piling up projects for my portfolio, thus this project.

I used Svelte in the making of this project because I enjoy its considerable lightweightedness in node_modules size compared to React. Besides, although the mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in one file is a bit unnerving at first, it's alright when you get used to it.

## [Many-In-One Calculator](https://davintristanieson.github.io/dist/many-in-one-calculator/)
**(01/06/2022)**
[Last Updated: 15/06/2022]

This project was started out of annoyance of having to open many tabs of online calculation websites and calculator applications. I'll update this project from time to time whenever I need any additional tools.

Current tools included: basic calculator, fraction calculator, factors (isPrime, factorization, GCD, LCM), basic trigonometry, permutation/combination, number-base converter, truth table, matrix calculator, modular arithmetic, sequences, expression parser, graph representation converter, and Djikstra.
