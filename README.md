Hello, this is the place where I'll host most of my front-end-based projects, feel free to visit them through the following links:

## [My Portfolio](URL "https://davintristanieson.github.io/portfolio/public/")
**(15/05/2022)**
I needed a place to store and display all the projects (at least, those related to front-end web development) that I plan to make in the future. Moreover,  I need to start piling up projects for my portfolio, thus this project.

I used Svelte in the making of this project because I enjoy its considerable lightweightedness in node_modules size compared to React. Besides, although the mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in one file is a bit unnerving at first, it's alright when you get used to it.
