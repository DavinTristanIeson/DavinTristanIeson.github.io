Moreover,  I need to start piling up projects for my portfolio, thus this project. \nI used Svelte in the making of this project because I enjoy its considerable lightweightedness in node_modules size compared to React. Besides, although the mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in one file is a bit unnerving at first, it's alright when you get used to it.",
